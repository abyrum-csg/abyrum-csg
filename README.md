## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a data science project manager in the Research Division at the [CSG Justice Center](https://csgjusticecenter.org/) where I work on data prep, analysis, and visualization using R.

## Here is a list of several projects I've recently led:

**Justice Reinvestment Iniative in North Carolina**
  
Building on prior work, this six-month project assessed the impact of the 2011 Justice Reinvestment Act (JRA) legislation in North Carolina. Utilizing both descriptive statistics and more advanced statistical methods, the analysis pinpointed changes in incarceration rates, revocations, and specific criminal justice outcomes following the implementation of North Carolina's JRA and its respective policies.

**Mock-up Dashboard for Reentry 2030**
  
The goal of the Reentry 2030 Dashboard is to provide states with the tools to track, analyze, and improve reentry outcomes for individuals transitioning from the criminal justice system back into the community. The dashboard will focus on a set of standardized outcome measures related to recidivism, employment, housing, and health.

**OJJDP Juvenile Justice Project in Virginia**
  
This project's aim was to assess statewide referral and diversion policies and practices, and identify opportunities to align DJJ diversion policies, practices, and resource allocation strategies with what research shows works to improve public safety and youth outcomes.

**Justice Counts Internal Tracking Tools**
  
Justice Counts is a consensus-building initiative of the U.S. Department of Justiceâ€™s Office of Justice Programsâ€™ Bureau of Justice Assistance led by The Council of State Governments (CSG) Justice Center and an coalition of 21 partner organizations representing wide-ranging expertise across the criminal justice field. As the project's data scientist, I led the development and maintenance of internal tracking tools for the Justice Counts initiative, supporting high-quality data collection from nearly 3,000 criminal justice agencies and enabling effective program monitoring

**50-State Violent Crime and Clearance Rate Project**
  
Using R and Quarto, I developed an interactive national- and state-level dashboard to display violent crime and clearance rate trends alongside a number of additional factors such as law enforcement funding and case-level characteristics and demographics. This work is hosted on the CSG Justice Center website via iframes.
